# Discover Countries

## An app for learning about general information about countries. Built in ReactJS.

By building this project, I learned:
- how to work with an API in React
- React Router
- React file and folder structure

The data for this website was taken from [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) 

To run the app, run `npm start` in the project directory
